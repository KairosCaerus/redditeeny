## Redditeeny

Reddit clone that I am creating in order to explore the facets of full-stack development and familiarize myself with the concepts and practices that go into the development of a full stack application. Much of the information contained in this readme is intended to serve as notes and information for myself

### Commands:
>**"watch"**: listens for changes in typescript files, compiles code to js and ouputs files to /dist, run in a terminal while developing to ensure that /dist files remain up to date\
>**"dev"**: listens for changes, rexecutes dist/index.js when changes are made, used during dev to auto deploy changes, same as "start" but updates after changing files, use during development\
>**"start"**: runs the code using node by executing the javascript code generated by the watch command, runs code stored in /dist, preferred method of execution\
>**"dev2"**: same as dev but executes using typescript instead of javascript\
>**"start2"**: runs the code using ts-node which executes typescript code, this is not used because it yields slow run times, additionally, when running production code ts is going to be converted to js, as such this command will not be used while developing
